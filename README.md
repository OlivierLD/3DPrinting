3D printed models elaboration, tools, hints, ideas, and stuff!

## OpenSCAD
[OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) is a programmatic approach to shape modeling. 
Re-usablity comes naturally with it, I like that!

You can generate your models with a (proprietary) functional programming language (good paper [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/For_C/Java/Python_Programmers)), and finally turn them into `stl` format,
which is understood by all 3D printers.
