# 3DPrinting
3D printed models elaboration, tools, hints, ideas, and stuff!

## [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/)
- Free and OpenSource
- DEsktop based
- Programmatic approach to shape modeling, _very_ cool.

> _Note:_ Re-usablity comes naturally with it, I like that!

You can generate your models with a (proprietary) functional programming language (good paper [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/For_C/Java/Python_Programmers)), and finally turn them into [`stl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) (short for _stereolithography_, originally) format, which is understood by all 3D printers.

Generating `stl` code by hand is just a nonsense, but take a look at the sizes of the `stl` and `scad` files (the one that contains the code)...

## Others
- [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/codeblocks), web-based, also has a programmatic approach, based on `blockly` or something similar.
- [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/), web-based, looks really good, but not always free.
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), programmable in Python.
- [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview), a reference, very good. But far from free...
- More to come...
