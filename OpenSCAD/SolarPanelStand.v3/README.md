### SunFlower, V3 <img src="../../cone.png" alt="WiP" width="48" height="48" align="middle">

This will look a lot like the SunFlower V2, but all the gears will be 3D printed too, no need to buy them, only the stepper motors are required, no extra axis, no worm gear.

For now, look in the `stl` folder to visualize the part designs.
