# OpenSCAD models
Each directory contains the code (`.scad`) along with the generated `stl` files (for visualization, when it makes any sense).

> The `stl` files describe the shape of the parts to print.
> Depending on the kind of material you will use (plastic, resin, metal, ceramic...),
> you will need to prepare those files for the specificities of your printer.
> This is where programs like `Cura Ultimaker` come in. This one will for example,
> turn the `stl` files into `gcode` ones.

> The path becomes in this case `scad` > `stl` > `gcode`.
