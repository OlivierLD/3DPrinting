# Feedback Potentiometer POC

## Setting

We have
- A continuous servo, rotating a small wheel.
- The small wheel rotates a big wheel.
- There is a B10K linear potentiometer attached to the big wheel, to measure its rotation state.

## And more

We will try - eventually - to drive such a device from the one presented [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/raspberry-coffee/blob/master/ADC-benchmark/LINEAR_POTS.md).
